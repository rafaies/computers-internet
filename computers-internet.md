## [Five Reasons Why the Internet is Bad](https://www.allthingstopics.com/a1-5-reasons-internet-is-bad.html)

Almost everyone agrees that the Internet is a good thing. We use the Internet in many ways. We can **go online** and play games, make new friends, and learn things. 

More than 4 billion people in the world use the Internet. However, not everything about the Internet is good. Here are five bad things about the Internet. 

- First, many people use the Internet too much. In the United States, it is common for people to use the Internet 24 hours each week, or about 3.4 hours each day. In Europe, many people say that the Internet is more important than watching TV, having a car, or even getting washed. They may not have the time to use their brains to think. 

- Second, some people use the Internet at work. This makes their boss angry and fire them. 

- Third, when people use the Internet so much, they may not be healthy because they don’t get much exercise. 

- Fourth, many people have "friends" on Facebook, but these may not be real friends. Real friends are people you can see **face-to-face**. Two or three real friends are better than 200 Facebook "friends" that you never see.

- Finally, some people are criminals. They are bad people and they use the Internet to try to steal your money.
